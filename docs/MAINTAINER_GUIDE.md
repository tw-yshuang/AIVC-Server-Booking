# **AIVC-Server-Booking Maintainer Manual**

For Host Maintainer & MLOps

## **1. Pre-required**

There has 3 things you must install before start it:
`nvidia-linux-driver`, `docker` and `nvidia-container-toolkit`

### Nvidia-Linux-Driver

Here is suggest to use apt to install the driver, use this [Nvidia Linux Driver Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html#ubuntu-lts) to install the latest version of GPU driver.

**Note**: If you are using others methods to install, make sure the **NVIDIA Linux Driver >= 418.81.07**, after install, please reboot the OS.

### Docker

Here is suggest to use apt to install the Docker, follow the [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) to install the Docker.

After that, you need to create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. So the you don't need to use `docker` command with `sudo`, and it is **must for this system**. see [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to setup.

**Note:** Docker >= 19.03

### Nvidia-Container-Toolkit

The NVIDIA Container Toolkit is available on a variety of Linux distributions and supports different container engines.

- [Platform Requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#platform-requirements)

- [Setting up NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#setting-up-nvidia-container-toolkit)

## **2. Installation of AIVC-Server-Booking System**

```bash
# To the project directory location
bash setup.sh
```
### Main Funciton:

The setup.sh is a file that needs to be executed during system **installation** and **updates**. It fully and automatically sets up the necessary files and packages. It performs the following tasks sequentially:

- Checks if there are any `job/monitor` files; if not, it creates them using the 'touch' command.
- Checks if the files `booking.csv`, `use.csv`, and `used.csv` exist; if not, it creates copies based on a template.
- Checks if the files `capability_config.yaml`, `host_deploy.yaml`, and `users_config.yaml` exist; if not, it creates copies based on a template.
- Utilize the `crontab` command to schedule the operating system to execute the program at specific times, achieving the goal of monitoring.
- Install required packages.
- Pull all the images from [tw-yshuang's Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rober5566a/aivc-server/general)
- Stop and remove the old container, then run the booking container on port 10000.

### Main function:

<!-- TODO: -->

### Variables:

1. **`volume_work_dir`**: `str`, 
The path contains folders with student IDs, and each folder stores user-specific data such as code and datasets.
   * ***Example:*** Folders within this path might store individualized information for each user, including code and datasets.
   * The default parent volume work directory. Usually, user's volume work direct will be: `volume_work_dir/userID`, please see [users_config.yaml](#users_configyaml) for more detail.
2. **`volume_dataset_dir`**: `str`,
This path includes publicly accessible datasets for all users to access.
   * ***Example:*** The path might contain datasets like the COCO dataset, available for use by all users.
3. **`volume_backup_dir`**: `str`,
This path also stores folders identified by student IDs, each holding backup files specific to that user.
   * ***Example:*** Folders within this path could store user-specific backup files, such as .pyenv and .zshrc.
4. **`users_config_yaml`**: `str`,
Points to the path of the users_config.yaml file.
5. **`capability_config_yaml`**: `str`,
Points to the path of the capability.yaml file.
6. **`images`**: `List[str]`,
Points to image files for different CUDA versions, allowing users to choose the corresponding version based on their needs.
   * ***Example:*** This could be used for selecting different CUDA versions of images according to the user's requirements.

<!-- TODO: -->

### Variables:

1. **`password`**: `str`,
Represents the user's password, displayed in plaintext for easy management.
2. **`forward_port`**: `int`,
Indicates the port number assigned to the user.
3. **`image`**: `str`,
Represents the image used for the user's container.
4. **`extra_command`**: `str`,
Refers to additional commands inputted by the user.
5. **`volume_work_dir`**: `str`,
The user's exclusive working directory.
6. **`volume_dataset_dir`**: `str`,
The directory for publicly accessible datasets.
7. **`volume_backup_dir`**: `str`,
The backup directory exclusively designated for the user.

---

## **`capability_config.yaml`**

### Main function:

<!-- TODO: -->

### Variables:

1. **`max`**: `Dict`, the maximum resource of this server can afford.
   1. **`cpus`**: `int`,
   Maximum CPU utilization.
   2. **`ram`**: `int`,
   Maximum RAM utilization.
   3. **`swap_size`**: `int`,
   Maximum swap space utilization.
   4. **`gpus`**: `int`,
   Maximum GPU utilization.
   5. **`shm_rate`**: 
   The ratio of swap space to RAM.
   6. **`memory`**: `int`,
   Available storage capacity.
   7. **`backup_space`**: `int`,
   Maximum allowable user backup space.
   8. **`work_space`**: `int`,
   Maximum allowable user workspace.

2. **`allow_userIDs`**: `List[str]`,

### Custom setting example:
```bash
'''Example 1'''
max_default_capability:
  cpus: 8

* Default maximum CPU is **8**.
* Default maximum memory is **32GB**.
* Default maximum GPU is **1**.
* Default maximum backup space is **50GB**.
* Default maximum work space is **200GB**.
